## The Story

Reckless Drivin' was one of *those* games. The kind that came pre-installed (or maybe my brothers found it on some shareware CD) on our family Mac back in the day. My brothers and I played it for hours, weaving through traffic, smashing into things, trying to beat each other's times.

Years later, I got hit with a tiny wave of nostalgia. I wanted to play it again, for old time's sake. Not in an emulator, not through some janky compatibility layer, but **running natively on my MacBook**.

The original source code had been [released on GitHub](https://github.com/jechter/RecklessDrivin) by Jonas Echterhoff in 2019 under the MIT license. How hard could it be, you'd say? Turns out: *very*. The original code was pure Classic Mac OS: PowerPC, big-endian, 32-bit, built with CodeWarrior, using DrawSprocket, InputSprocket, the Mac Sound Manager, and Mac Resource Forks. None of that exists anymore. Every platform API had to be replaced. Every byte of game data was stored backwards relative to my CPU. It was a rabbit hole, and I went all the way down.

This is the result: a port of Reckless Drivin' with all 10 levels, every screen, and every effect, running natively with pixel-perfect graphics, proper audio, and full mouse + keyboard + gamepad controls.

## Quick Start

### Requirements

| | |
|---|---|
| **OS** | macOS (Apple Silicon or Intel), Linux |
| **Compiler** | Clang or GCC (C11) |
| **Build tool** | CMake 3.16+ |
| **Library** | SDL2 |

### Build & Run on macOS

```bash
# Install CMake
brew install cmake

# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/DarrCoh/reckless-drivin-sdl.git

# Build
cd reckless-drivin-sdl
./build-mac-app.sh

# Run (double-click or from terminal)
open "build/Reckless Drivin'.app"
```

The build produces a self-contained `Reckless Drivin'.app` bundle with the `Data` file and SDL2 bundled inside, plus a `.dmg` for easy distribution. No SDL2 install required on the recipient's machine.

Since the app is not notarized, macOS will quarantine it when downloaded. Recipients can either run `xattr -cr "/path/to/Reckless Drivin'.app"` in Terminal, or open it and go to System Settings > Privacy & Security to allow it.

### Build & Run on Linux

```bash
# Install CMake and SDL2 (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt install cmake libsdl2-dev

# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/DarrCoh/reckless-drivin-sdl.git

# Build
cd reckless-drivin-sdl
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .

# Run
./RecklessDrivin
```

The build produces a standard executable and copies `Data` next to it.

<summary><h2>The Porting Journey</h2></summary>

This wasn't a simple recompile. The original game was written for a world that no longer exists.

### The Platform Layer

The original game used five major Mac-specific APIs. Every one had to be replaced:

| Original Mac API | Purpose | SDL2 Replacement |
|---|---|---|
| DrawSprocket | Screen management, page flipping, gamma fades | SDL2 window + renderer + streaming texture |
| InputSprocket | Gamepad/keyboard input abstraction | SDL2 event polling + keyboard state + mouse |
| Sound Manager | Multi-channel audio mixing | Custom 18-channel software mixer |
| Resource Manager | Loading assets from resource forks | Custom resource fork parser |
| DriverServices | High-resolution timing | `SDL_GetPerformanceCounter()` |

### The Compatibility Layer

The original code uses Mac-specific types everywhere: `UInt8`, `UInt16`, `Handle`, `Str255`, `nil`... `compat.h` maps all of these to modern C equivalents, plus provides `NewPtr()`, `NewHandle()`, `BlockMoveData()`, and byte-swapping macros.

### The Resource Fork Parser

Mac OS stored data in "resource forks": a structured binary format with typed, numbered entries. The game's `Data` file contains 22 `Pack` resources (compressed game data), 10 `PPic` resources (PICT images in both 8-bit and 16-bit formats), and 1 `Chck` resource. The custom parser (`resources.c`) reads the resource map and returns data by type + ID. Pack resources use LZRW3-A compression (public domain, by Ross Williams).

### Endianness: Everything Is Backwards

PowerPC is big-endian. Apple Silicon is little-endian. Every multi-byte value in every data structure was stored in the wrong byte order: 16-bit pixels, 32-bit object fields, RLE sprite tokens, sound headers, floating-point road data, and even the XOR encryption key for locked levels. Getting any one of these wrong produced garbled colors, corrupted sprites, or audio that sounded like a fax machine.

### The `sizeof(long)` Bug

On 32-bit PowerPC, `sizeof(long) == 4`. On 64-bit ARM64, `sizeof(long) == 8`. The original RLE renderer had manual copy loops using `long`-sized chunks; each iteration copied 8 bytes instead of 4, overwriting adjacent memory and causing immediate SIGBUS crashes. Four separate rendering functions had to be rewritten.

### The RLE Sprite Format

Custom 4-byte token format (1 byte type + 3 bytes big-endian data). Token parsing used `*(unsigned long*)ptr`: wrong endianness AND wrong size on ARM64. Every token parser in the game had to be replaced with explicit byte reads.

### The Sound System

Sound data contains embedded Mac SoundHeader structures (not raw PCM). Standard headers (22 bytes, 8-bit unsigned, ~11 kHz) and Extended headers (64 bytes, 16-bit signed BE, 44.1 kHz) are mixed throughout. The mixer had to detect the header type, extract the actual PCM data, and apply per-channel rate correction (`basePitch = nativeRate / 44100`).

### The PICT Renderer

Menu screens are stored as Mac PICT v2 images with LZRW3-A compression. Two pixel formats are used: 16-bit DirectBitsRect (`0x009A`) for most screens, and 8-bit indexed PackBitsRect (`0x0098`) with embedded color tables for others. Both formats use PackBits row compression.

### The Encryption

Levels 4-10 were encrypted in the original shareware distribution. The XOR-based decryption operates on 32-bit words in memory, but the encryption was applied on big-endian PowerPC, so the key's byte pattern in memory is reversed on little-endian ARM64. A byte-swap of the key before XOR was required for decryption to produce valid data. The free registration key (name: `Free`, code: `B3FB09B1EB`) was [published by the author](http://jonasechterhoff.com/Reckless_Drivin.html) when the game went freeware.

### The Pascal String Off-by-One

One crash only appeared during gameplay when picking up a specific power-up. The "ADDONS LOCKED" text effect used a Pascal string: a format where the first byte is the length, followed by that many characters. The length byte said 15 (`\x0f`), but the actual string `"ADDONShLOCKEDf"` was only 14 characters. On the original Mac, the text renderer had no bounds checking; it would read the 15th byte (a NUL from the struct initializer), try to look up font glyph 63 (`0 - 'A' + 128`) in the sprite pack, land on some random memory, and get away with it. On the SDL port, bounds checking on pack lookups returned NULL, and `NULL + 8` became a segfault. A bug that silently survived 25 years on PowerPC.

### The NULL Safety Audit

The Pascal string crash revealed a broader pattern: the original code *never* checks return values. `NewObject()` allocates a game object and looks up its type definition from a resource pack; if the type ID doesn't exist, the original Mac code would silently read garbage memory and keep going. `GetSortedPackEntry()` and `GetUnsortedPackEntry()` are called dozens of times across the codebase, and every single callsite assumes success. On PowerPC with flat memory and no ASLR, dereferencing a wild pointer might corrupt something silently or just happen to land on valid-ish data. On ARM64 with strict memory protection, it's an instant segfault.

A full audit of every pack lookup callsite across the codebase found 15 unguarded dynamic-ID paths: places where the lookup ID comes from gameplay state (object types, weapon projectiles, debris, explosions, smoke, font glyphs) rather than hardcoded constants. Each was given a NULL guard with graceful degradation: `NewObject()` unlinks and frees on failure, `KillObject()` falls back to `RemoveObject()`, particle effects silently skip, and sprite draws bail out early. The result is a game that can survive a missing resource entry without crashing; something the original never needed because the Mac OS memory model was far more forgiving.

### The Optimization Pass

A performance audit of the finished port found it was mostly clean: no memory leaks, no redundant texture creation, no O(n^2) collision loops, packs decompressed once and cached. But the build had been running at `-O0` (no optimizations) the entire time. Enabling `-O3` with Link-Time Optimization shrank the binary from 272 KB to 211 KB and gave the compiler room to inline and optimize across all 30+ source files. The one hot-path issue was `pow(10, i)` being called every frame for score rendering: a floating-point exponentiation where an integer lookup table (`{1, 10, 100, 1000, ...}`) does the same job in a single array access.

### The App Bundle

The original Reckless Drivin' was a proper Mac application: double-clickable, with an icon in the Dock. The SDL port should be too. CMake builds a native `.app` bundle on macOS: `Info.plist` for metadata, the `Data` file in `Contents/Resources`, and SDL2.framework bundled inside `Contents/Frameworks`. The build script downloads the official SDL2 universal framework and produces a fat binary (arm64 + x86_64), so the app runs on both Apple Silicon and Intel Macs. The deployment target is macOS 11.0 (Big Sur), the first macOS release with Apple Silicon support. A packaging script produces a `.dmg` for easy distribution.

## Known Limitations

- `Cl16` resource id=8 not found at startup (cosmetic; a synthetic fallback palette is used)
- PPic 1009 (original scrolling credits image) contains QuickDraw text commands that can't be rasterized; replaced with bitmap font credits
- Gamepad button remapping is not yet exposed in the UI (SDL2's standard mappings handle most controllers automatically)
